The CALM project is joint effort lead by [NCAI](https://sdaia.gov.sa/ncai/?Lang=en) in collaboration with [Yandex](https://yandex.com/) and [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) to train an Arabic language model with volunteers from around the globe. The project is an adaptation of the framework proposed at the NeurIPS 2021 demonstration: [Training Transformers Together](https://huggingface.co/training-transformers-together). 

One of the main obstacles facing many researchers in the Arabic NLP community is the lack of computing resources that are needed for training large models. Models with leading performane on Arabic NLP tasks, such as [AraBERT](https://github.com/aub-mind/arabert), [CamelBERT](https://github.com/CAMeL-Lab/CAMeLBERT), [AraELECTRA](https://huggingface.co/aubmindlab/araelectra-base-generator), and [QARiB](https://huggingface.co/qarib), took days to train on TPUs. In the spirit of democratization of AI and community enabling, a core value at NCAI, CALM aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of collaborative training and form a community of volunteers for ANLP researchers with basic level cloud GPUs who wish to train their own models collaboratively. 

CALM trains a single BERT model on a dataset that combines MSA, Oscar and Arabic Wikipedia, and dialectal data for the gulf region from existing open source datasets. Each volunteer GPU trains the model locally at its own pace on a portion of the dataset while another portion is being streamed in the background to reduces local memory consumption. Computing the gradients and aggregating them is performed in a distributed manner, based on the computing abilities of each participating volunteer. Details of the distributed training process are further described in the paper [Deep Learning in Open Collaborations](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2021/hash/41a60377ba920919939d83326ebee5a1-Abstract.html).

## How to participate in training?

To join the collaborative training, all you have to do is to keep a notebook running for **at least 15 minutes**, you're free to close it after that and join again in another time. There are few steps before running the notebook:

1. Create an account on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co).
2. Join the [NCAI-CALM Organization](https://huggingface.co/CALM) on Huggingface through the invitation link shared with you by email.
3. Get your Access Token, it's later required in the notebook
    1. Go to your [HF account](https://huggingface.co/settings/token).
    2. Go to Settings â‡’ Access Tokens.
    3. Generate a new Access Token and enter any name for `what's this token for`.
    4. Select read role.
    5. Copy your access token.
    6. Paste it in the notebook once it prompts you in cell number 4.

## How to host your own experiment?

Here you can find the best practices that we learned from running the CALM experiment. These may help you set up your own collaborative experiment.

If your training run is not confidential, feel free to ask for help on the [hivemind discord channel](https://discord.gg/vRNN9ua2)

<details>
  <summary><b> 1. Choose and verify your training configuration</b></summary>  
  
  Depending on you use case, you may want to change
   - Dataset and preprocessing ([`data.py`](https://github.com/NCAI-Research/CALM/blob/main/tasks/mlm/data.py), [`data_cleaning.py`](https://github.com/NCAI-Research/CALM/blob/main/tasks/mlm/data_cleaning.py), [`whole_word_mask.py`](https://github.com/NCAI-Research/CALM/blob/main/tasks/mlm/whole_word_mask.py);
   - Tokenizer (see [`arguments.py`](https://github.com/NCAI-Research/CALM/blob/main/arguments.py#L110-L112))
   - Model config ([`model.json`](https://github.com/NCAI-Research/CALM/blob/main/tasks/mlm/model.json)
  
  
  When transitioning to a new language or new dataset, it is important to check that the tokenizer/collator works as intended **before** you begin training.
  The best way to do that is to manually look at training minibatches:
  ```python
  from tasks.mlm.data import make_training_dataset
  from tasks.mlm.whole_word_mask import DataCollatorForWholeWordMask
  
  tokenizer = create_tokenizer_here(...)
  dataset = make_training_dataset(tokenizer, max_sequence_length=...)  # see arguments.py
  collator = DataCollatorForWholeWordMask(tokenizer, pad_to_multiple_of=...)  # see arguments.py
  data_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, collate_fn=collator, batch_size=4)

  # generate a few batches
  rows = []
  with tqdm(enumerate(data_loader)) as progress:
      for i, row in progress:
          rows.append(row)
          if i > 10:
              break
  
  # look into the training data
  row_ix, sample_ix = 0, 1
  sources = [tokenizer.decode([i]) for i in rows[row_ix]['input_ids'][sample_ix].data.numpy()]
  print("MASK RATE:", (rows[row_ix]['input_ids'][sample_ix] == 4).data.numpy().sum() / (rows[row_ix]['input_ids'][sample_ix] != 0).data.numpy().sum())

  for i in range(len(sources)):
      if sources[i] == '[MASK]':
          pass#sources[i] = '[[' + tokenizer.decode(rows[row_ix]['labels'][sample_ix][i].item()) + ']]'

  print(' '.join(sources))
  ```
  
  If you make many changes, it also helps to train a very model using your own device to check if everything works as intended. A good initial configuration is 6 layers, 512 hidden, 2048 intermediate).
  
  If you're training with volunteers, the most convenient way is to set up a Hugging Face organization. For instructions on that, see "make your own" section of https://training-transformers-together.github.io . We use WANDB for tracking logs and training progress: we've set up a [WandB team](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/app/features/teams) named [CALM](https://wandb.ai/calm) for this experiment. Alternatively, you can use hivemind standalone (and even without internet access) by setting --authorize False and WANDB_DISABLED=true -- or manually removing the corresponding options from the code.

  <summary> <b>2. Setting up auxiliary peers</b> </summary>

Auxiliary peers are low-end servers without GPU that will keep track of the latest model checkpoint and report metrics and assist in communication.
You will need 1-3 workers that track metrics, upload statistics, etc. These peers do not use GPU.
If you have many participants are behind firewall (in --client_mode), it helps to add more auxiliary servers, as they can serve as relays and help with all-reduce.
  
__Minimum requirements:__ 15+ GB RAM, at least 100Mbit/s download/upload speed, at least one port opened to incoming connections;

__Where to get:__ cloud providers that have cheap ingress/egress pricing. Good examples: [pebblehost](https://pebblehost.com/dedicated/) "Essential-01" and [hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) CX41. Path of the true jedi: use your homelab or university server -- but that may require networking experience. AWS/GCP/Azure has similar offers, but they cost more due to [egress pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/network-pricing).


__Setup env:__

```
sudo apt install -y git tmux
curl https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.11-Linux-x86_64.sh > Anaconda3-2021.11-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda3-2021.11-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p ~/anaconda3
source ~/anaconda3/bin/activate
conda install -y pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch

git clone https://github.com/NCAI-Research/CALM/
pip install https://github.com/learning-at-home/hivemind/archive/calm.zip
cd CALM && pip install -q -r requirements.txt &> log

# re-install bitsandbytes for the actual CUDA version
pip uninstall -y bitsandbytes-cuda111
pip install -y bitsandbytes-cuda113==0.26.0

curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
git lfs install
```


__Run auxiliary worker:__

1. Open a tmux (or screen) session that will stay up after you logout. (`tmux new` , [about tmux](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/))
2. Generate peer ID ahead of time

```bash
curl -L https://www.dropbox.com/s/p1hi93ahy5295jf/p2p-keygen?dl=1 > p2p-keygen
chmod +x p2p-keygen
./p2p-keygen -f ./identity


```
This ensures that if you restart the peer during training, it will have the same identity, which is useful if others use your worker as initial peer.
  
3. Measure internet bandwidth and set `$BANDWIDTH` variable
```bash

# You can measure bandwidth automatically:
curl -s https://gist.githubusercontent.com/justheuristic/5467799d8f2ad59b36fa75f642cc9b87/raw/c5a4b9b66987c2115e6c54a07d97e0104dfbcd97/speedtest.py | python -  --json > speedtest.json
export BANDWIDTH=`python -c "import json; speedtest = json.load(open('speedtest.json')); print(int(max(1, min(speedtest['upload'], speedtest['download']) / 1e6)))"`
echo "Internet Bandwidth (Mb/s) = $BANDWIDTH"
  
# If that doesn't work, you can simply `export BANDWIDTH=TODOyour_bandwidth_mbits_here` using the minimum of download and upload speed.
```
  

4. Run the auxiliary peer
```bash
export MY_IP=`curl --ipv4 -s http://whatismyip.akamai.com/`
export PORT=12345   # please choose a port where you can accept incoming tcp connections (or open that port if you're on a cloud)

export LISTEN_ON=/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/$PORT
export ANNOUNCE_ON=/ip4/$MY_IP/tcp/$PORT

# note: you can avoid setting the two tokens above: in that case, the script will ask you to login to wandb and huggingface
  
# activate your anaconda environment
source ~/anaconda3/bin/activate


ulimit -n 16384 # this line is important, ignoring it may cause Too Many Open Files

python run_aux_peer.py --run_id $EXP_NAME --host_maddrs $LISTEN_ON --announce_maddrs $ANNOUNCE_ON --wandb_project $WANDB_PROJECT --identity ./identity --store_checkpoints --upload_interval 43200 --repo_url $HF_ORGANIZATION_NAME/$HF_MODEL_NAME --authorize --assist_in_averaging --bandwidth $BANDWIDTH
# Optionally, add more peers to the training via `--initial_peers ONE_OR_MORE PEERS_HERE`
```

If everything went right, it will print its address as such:

Please copy this address and use it as ``--initial_peers`` with GPU/TPU trainers and other auxiliary peers.

  <summary><b>3. Setting up a trainer</b></summary>
Trainers are peers with GPUs (or other compute accelerators) that compute gradients, average them via all-reduce and perform optimizer steps.
There are two broad types of trainers: normal (full) peers and client mode peers. Client peers rely on others to average their gradients, but otherwise behave same as full peers. You can designate your trainer as a client-only using the `--client_mode` flag.
  
__When do I need client mode?__ if a peer is unreliable (e.g. will likely be gone in 1 hour) OR sits behind a firewall that blocks incoming connections OR has very unstable internet connection, it should be a client. For instance, it is recommended to set colab / kaggle peers as clients. In turn, cloud GPUs (even spot instances!) are generally more reliable and should be full peers.

Participating as a client is easy, you can find the code for that in **this colab notebook(TODO)**. Setting up a full peer is more difficult,
### Set up environment:

This part is the same as in auxiliary peer, except we don't need LFS (that was needed to upload checkpoints).
```bash
sudo apt install -y git tmux
curl https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.11-Linux-x86_64.sh > Anaconda3-2021.11-Linux-x86_64.sh

  --per_device_train_batch_size 1 --gradient_accumulation_steps 1
# you can tune per_device_train_batch_size, gradient_accumulation steps, --fp16, --gradient_checkpoints based on the device. A good rule of thumb is that the device should compute (batch size x num accumulations) gradients over 1-10 seconds. Setting very large gradient_accumulation_steps can cause your peer to miss an averaging round.

```

<details>
  <summary><b>Best (and worst) practices</b></summary>
    
  __Hardware requirements:__ The code is meant to run with the following specs: 2-core CPU, 12gb RAM (more if you train a bigger model). Peers used as `--initial_peers` must be accessible by others, so you may need to open a network port for incoming connections. The rest depends on what role you're playing:

      - __Auxiliary peers:__  If you use `--upload_interval X --repo_url Y` must have enough disk space to store all the checkpoints. For instance, assuming that training takes 1 month and the model+optimizer state takes 1GB, you will need 30GB with `--upload_interval 86400`, 60GB if `--upload_interval 28800`, etc. If `assist_in_averaging`, ensure you have at least 100Mbit/s bandwidth, more is better.
    
      - __Trainers__ need *some* means for compute: a GPU with at least 6GB memory or a TPU - as long as you can run pytorch on that. You will need to tune `--per_device_train_batch_size X` to fit into memory. Also, you can use `--fp16` even on old GPUs to save memory. Finally, `--gradient_checkpointing` can reduce memory usage at the cost of 30-40% slower training. Non-client-mode peers must have at least 100Mbit/s network bandwidth, mode is better.
    
    
  (THE TEXT BELOW IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION)
  
  __Swarm composition:__ 2-3 peers with public IP as `--initial_peers` for redundancy.
    
__Support infrastructure: go cheap, go redundant.__ 

<details>
  <summary>Where to get cheap servers</summary>
    - 

- full redundancy, three instances of everything
- client-to-averager ratio
- gradient checkpointing
- multiple GPUs per peer
- if aux peers have less ram, you can assign it to only parts of functionality, e.g. disable --upload_interval
  
Training chronicles:
  - 2021 Nov & early Dec - collecting the data, preparing the code

  - 2022.01.02 - added [the dashboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CALM/Dashboard) that shows training progress and contributions (by @SaulLu)
  - status on TPU: @justheuristic got it running, but it takes just a bit more RAM than we have available (so it works for a slightly smaller model)
  - 2022.01.04 - got too many volunteers, some noticed that gradient averaging does not finish in time (TimeoutError in logs)
  - 2022.01.07 - added more auxiliary peers from the same source (pebblehost, trying hetzner)
  - To be continued
