### Start training
#### 1. Using Kaggle **(recommended)**
[![Open In Kaggle](https://img.shields.io/badge/kaggle-Open%20in%20Kaggle-blue.svg)](https://www.kaggle.com/prmais/volunteer-gpu-notebook)

Kaggle gives you around 40 hrs per week of GPU time, so it's preferred over Colab, unless it's a Colab Pro.

#### 2. Using Google Colab

#### 3. Running locally
If you have additional local computing GPUs, please visit our discord channel for instructions to set it.
